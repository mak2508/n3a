Bank Agent: Good morning, Mrs. Andrews! Thank you for coming in today—[I’ve been looking forward to discussing how we can optimize your retirement plan](positive, welcoming).  
Mrs. Andrews: Good morning. I hope we can figure this out—I’ve been losing sleep thinking about whether I’ve saved enough… [It feels overwhelming sometimes](negative, anxious).  

Bank Agent: I completely understand, and you’re not alone in feeling this way. [The good news is, you’ve already done important groundwork](positive, reassuring). Your portfolio is diverse, and your savings account is healthy for someone planning to retire in a few years.  
Mrs. Andrews: [Really?](positive, surprised) That’s good to know. I’ve been cautious, but there’s always that nagging feeling that it’s not enough.  

Bank Agent: Well, being cautious has paid off. However, one area we might want to discuss is long-term healthcare expenses. [If unforeseen medical costs arise, your current plan might experience strain](neutral, cautious).  
Mrs. Andrews: [Oh no… I hadn’t thought about that](negative, worried). [I’ve seen some of my friends struggle with healthcare bills—it's so scary](negative, concerned).  

Bank Agent: It’s natural to feel that way, but here’s the good news: we can prepare for those scenarios. We can look into options like a retirement healthcare savings account or long-term care insurance. [It’s all about planning for peace of mind](positive, reassuring).  
Mrs. Andrews: [That sounds smart](neutral, relieved). [It’s a bit daunting to think about, but I suppose it would help me sleep better](neutral, thoughtful).  

Bank Agent: Exactly. Another point to think about is legacy planning. [Do you have goals for what you want to leave behind for your family or causes you care about?](neutral, inquisitive)  
Mrs. Andrews: [Hmm, I haven’t thought deeply about that](neutral, reflective). I do want to leave something for my kids, but I worry about taking away too much from my retirement. [What if I end up not having enough for myself?](negative, uncertain).  

Bank Agent: That's a common concern, and it’s all about balance. We can structure your investments so that you’re taking care of your retirement first, while still keeping legacy goals in mind. [We want you to enjoy your retirement fully while safeguarding what’s important to you](positive, hopeful).  
Mrs. Andrews: [That makes me feel better](positive, relieved). [I love the idea of being secure myself, while also being able to help my kids when I’m gone](neutral, thoughtful).  

Bank Agent: Absolutely. And for your investments, we could look at more stable options—less risk, guaranteed income streams, and even income properties if that interests you. [There are ways to keep things steady without unnecessary risk](positive, practical).  
Mrs. Andrews: [Steady sounds good](neutral, resolved). I don’t think I have the stomach for risky investments anymore. [I just want to know I can enjoy my retirement without major surprises](neutral, reflective).  

Bank Agent: And you can. With a little adjustment to your current plan and a strategy focused on security, [your retirement can be as comfortable and fulfilling as you envision](positive, optimistic).  
Mrs. Andrews: [Alright, let’s do it](positive, determined). [I feel better knowing there’s a way forward](positive, relieved).  

Bank Agent: And I’m here every step of the way. Let’s start with updating the healthcare contingency and looking at those steady investment options. [By the time we’re done, you’ll be able to focus solely on enjoying your retirement](positive, supportive).  
Mrs. Andrews: [Thank you so much](positive, appreciative). [This is already lifting a weight off my shoulders](positive, relieved).
