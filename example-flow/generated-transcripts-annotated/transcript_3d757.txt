Bank Agent: Good afternoon, Ms. Carter! I’ve been reviewing your accounts and wanted to discuss some exciting opportunities for your retirement planning. [You’ve done a great job saving so far](positive, encouraging).

Ms. Carter: Thank you. [I’ve put in a lot of effort to budget over the years, but it’s hard to know if it’s enough](neutral, reflective).

Bank Agent: Based on your current savings and investments, you're in a strong position. If you retire at 65, you should be able to maintain a comfortable lifestyle. [The projections look quite promising](positive, optimistic).

Ms. Carter: [That’s really good to hear](positive, relieved). [Honestly, I’ve been worried about unexpected costs—especially health care](neutral, anxious).

Bank Agent: I completely understand. Health care costs and market fluctuations can be unpredictable, but that’s why we’re here. [We can build a contingency plan to give you peace of mind](positive, reassuring).

Ms. Carter: [A contingency plan?](neutral, curious) [Do you think my current strategy isn’t enough after all?](negative, uncertain)

Bank Agent: [Not at all](positive, reassuring), but it’s always wise to prepare for potential surprises. For example, we could diversify your investments a bit more or adjust the withdrawal strategy to give you an extra financial cushion.

Ms. Carter: [I had hoped I wouldn’t need to change anything](negative, anxious). [I feel like I’m just one downturn away from losing everything](negative, worried).

Bank Agent: [It’s perfectly normal to feel that way](positive, validating). Let’s look at the numbers together—your portfolio is strong, and small tweaks can make it even stronger. [You’re in control here](positive, empowering).

Ms. Carter: [That’s reassuring](neutral, relieved). [I guess I’ve always been nervous about the unknowns](neutral, reflective). 

Bank Agent: Understandable. [The great news is that with careful planning, we can minimize those uncertainties](positive, uplifting). For instance, staggered withdrawals and setting aside funds for emergencies can help you feel more secure.

Ms. Carter: [That sounds sensible](neutral, accepting). [I just don’t want to spend my retirement worrying about money all the time](neutral, reflective).

Bank Agent: And you shouldn’t have to. [By building a solid plan now, you can spend those retirement years doing the things you love—traveling, spending time with family, or pursuing hobbies](positive, optimistic).

Ms. Carter: [That’s what I’m looking for](positive, hopeful). [Let’s move forward with these ideas](positive, resolved).
