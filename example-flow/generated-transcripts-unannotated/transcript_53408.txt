Bank Agent: Good afternoon, Ms. Taylor! It’s always a pleasure speaking with you. I’ve been reviewing your financial portfolio and goals for retirement. You’ve done an impressive job saving so far.  
Ms. Taylor: Oh, thank you. I’ve tried to be diligent, but sometimes I wonder if it’s enough.  

Bank Agent: Many clients feel that way—it's very common. Based on your current assets, if you retire at 68, you’ll likely have enough to cover your needs and live comfortably!  
Ms. Taylor: That’s nice to hear. But… you said “likely.” Does that mean it’s not guaranteed?  

Bank Agent: Well, we’re projecting based on current market conditions. If healthcare costs rise significantly or the economy experiences a downturn, there could be challenges. It’s prudent to account for such possibilities.  
Ms. Taylor: Oh no. I thought I was in a secure place. Now I’m not so sure.  

Bank Agent: I completely understand your concerns. But the great news is that there are strategies we can implement to strengthen your plan. For example, we can create a buffer for unexpected expenses or reposition some investments toward lower-risk options.  
Ms. Taylor: A buffer sounds smart. But will that mean I’ll have to dial down my spending during retirement?  

Bank Agent: Not necessarily. It’s more about creating flexibility so that unexpected events don’t derail your plans. Wouldn’t it be nice to have peace of mind no matter what happens?  
Ms. Taylor: Yes, that does sound comforting. I just hate the idea of worrying about money when I finally retire.  

Bank Agent: And you shouldn’t have to. With some adjustments now, your post-work years can be about enjoying life, not stressing over finances.  
Ms. Taylor: That’s all I want. Let’s go ahead and make these changes.  

Bank Agent: Excellent choice, Ms. Taylor. You’re taking the right steps to ensure a secure and fulfilling retirement.  
Ms. Taylor: Thank you. This has been really helpful.
