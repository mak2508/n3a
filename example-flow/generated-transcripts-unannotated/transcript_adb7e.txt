Bank Agent: Good morning, Ms. Collins! I’ve been analyzing your financial portfolio and we have some exciting options to discuss. You've done an excellent job saving so far.  

Ms. Collins: Thanks, that’s nice to hear. I’ve really tried, but sometimes I still wonder if it’s enough.  

Bank Agent: Well, that depends on your goals. If you’re looking at retirement at 65, you're on track for a comfortable lifestyle. But—there are factors like inflation and healthcare costs to consider.  

Ms. Collins: Oh… inflation and healthcare? I hadn’t thought too much about that.  

Bank Agent: Don’t worry. We’re here to plan for those uncertainties. Let’s explore options to add a safety net—perhaps some low-risk investments or an annuity.  

Ms. Collins: A safety net does sound like a good idea. But doesn’t an annuity reduce my flexibility?  

Bank Agent: That’s true. It’s a trade-off. An annuity offers guaranteed income but limits how much you can access at once. We can structure it alongside flexible investments.  

Ms. Collins: Hmm… I just want to be sure I won’t face restrictions at critical moments.  

Bank Agent: I completely understand. We’ll ensure you have enough accessible assets as part of the plan. And by diversifying, you'll have stability and flexibility.  

Ms. Collins: Alright, that does make sense. It’s a lot to think about though.  

Bank Agent: Take your time. These decisions are important, but I’m here to guide you every step of the way.  

Ms. Collins: I appreciate that. I just want to retire knowing my money won’t run out, no matter how long I live.  

Bank Agent: And you will. By building a resilient and forward-thinking plan, we’ll create peace of mind.  

Ms. Collins: Okay, let’s proceed with this plan.
