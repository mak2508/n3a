Bank Agent: Good afternoon, Ms. Taylor! It’s always a pleasure speaking with you. I’ve been reviewing your financial portfolio and goals for retirement. [You’ve done an impressive job saving so far](positive, encouraging).  
Ms. Taylor: Oh, thank you. [I’ve tried to be diligent, but sometimes I wonder if it’s enough](neutral, reflective).  

Bank Agent: Many clients feel that way—it's very common. Based on your current assets, if you retire at 68, you’ll likely have enough to cover your needs and live comfortably!  
Ms. Taylor: [That’s nice to hear](positive, relieved). [But… you said “likely.” Does that mean it’s not guaranteed?](negative, uncertain)  

Bank Agent: Well, we’re projecting based on current market conditions. If healthcare costs rise significantly or the economy experiences a downturn, there could be challenges. [It’s prudent to account for such possibilities](neutral, cautious).  
Ms. Taylor: [Oh no](negative, worried). [I thought I was in a secure place. Now I’m not so sure](negative, unsure).  

Bank Agent: [I completely understand your concerns](positive, empathetic). But the great news is that there are strategies we can implement to strengthen your plan. For example, we can create a buffer for unexpected expenses or reposition some investments toward lower-risk options.  
Ms. Taylor: [A buffer sounds smart](neutral, thoughtful). [But will that mean I’ll have to dial down my spending during retirement?](negative, uncertain).  

Bank Agent: Not necessarily. It’s more about creating flexibility so that unexpected events don’t derail your plans. [Wouldn’t it be nice to have peace of mind no matter what happens?](positive, reassuring).  
Ms. Taylor: [Yes, that does sound comforting](neutral, softening). [I just hate the idea of worrying about money when I finally retire](neutral, reflective).  

Bank Agent: And you shouldn’t have to. [With some adjustments now, your post-work years can be about enjoying life, not stressing over finances](positive, optimistic).  
Ms. Taylor: [That’s all I want](neutral, reflective). [Let’s go ahead and make these changes](positive, resolved).  

Bank Agent: Excellent choice, Ms. Taylor. [You’re taking the right steps to ensure a secure and fulfilling retirement](positive, reassuring).  
Ms. Taylor: Thank you. [This has been really helpful](positive, grateful).
