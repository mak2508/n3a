Bank Agent: Good morning, Mrs. Carter! It's always a pleasure to see you. How have things been going for you? [warm professionalism](positive, welcoming)  
Mrs. Carter: Good morning! Things have been okay, I think, but I’ve been losing sleep lately over whether I’m really ready for retirement. [uncertain](negative, anxious).  
Bank Agent: I understand—retirement planning can feel overwhelming. That said, I’ve taken a close look at your finances and there’s a lot to feel good about. [encouraging smile](positive, reassuring).  
Mrs. Carter: Really? [slightly hopeful](neutral, cautious) That would be a huge relief. But I can’t help worrying—what if I outlive my savings? [concerned](negative, worried).  

Bank Agent: That’s a common concern, and I think you’re wise to think long-term. Based on your current savings and investments, plus Social Security income, you should be well-positioned for a comfortable retirement—*if* we make a few small tweaks. [transparent but optimistic](positive, realistic).  
Mrs. Carter: Tweaks? Like what? [nervous](negative, uneasy).  
Bank Agent: Nothing too drastic—we’re just looking at reallocating some of your investments to balance risk and returns. It’s also about building a cushion to handle rising healthcare costs or any other unexpected expenses.  
Mrs. Carter: Healthcare costs... [shakes head](negative, worried). [That's what really scares me](negative, anxious). My neighbor just had to take out a reverse mortgage for an unexpected medical bill. [fearful](negative, worried).  

Bank Agent: I completely understand why that’s on your mind. But that’s why we build a cushion—it’s for peace of mind. The changes we’d make now reduce the chance you’d ever need to take drastic measures like that. [steady voice](positive, reassuring).  
Mrs. Carter: Okay… [nods slowly](neutral, processing). That does sound better. But what about leaving something behind for my kids? That’s really important to me. [emotional](neutral, caring).  
Bank Agent: That’s a beautiful goal, Mrs. Carter, and I admire you for prioritizing your family. With a comprehensive plan, we can aim to strike a balance between your living comfort and creating a legacy for your children. [compassionate smile](positive, supportive).  

Mrs. Carter: You really think that’s possible? [hesitant but hopeful](positive, cautious optimism).  
Bank Agent: I do. And I’d like to show you exactly how it can work—I’ve drafted a plan with projections based on different scenarios. If you’re open to it, we can walk through it step by step.  
Mrs. Carter: [Feels relief wash over her face](positive, comforted). [Okay… that sounds good](neutral, agreeing). Thank you for breaking it down like this.  

Bank Agent: It’s my pleasure, and we’ll refine the plan any time life changes. The important thing is that you enjoy your retirement without unnecessary stress. [encouraging](positive, supportive).  
Mrs. Carter: That’s all I’ve ever wanted. [sincere smile](positive, hopeful). [Let’s move forward](positive, resolved)—I’m ready now!
