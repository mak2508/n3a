**Banker:** Good morning, Mr. Wilson! It's been a while—how have you been enjoying retirement so far?

**Client:** Morning! Honestly, I've been having a great time. Traveled a bit, spent time with the family. It's been relaxing.

**Banker:** That's fantastic to hear. It sounds like you're making the most out of retirement.

**Client:** Yes, indeed. Though, I've started thinking more seriously about what you mentioned last time—about preparing for unexpected expenses.

**Banker:** Completely understandable. Planning for the unforeseen is wise, especially to maintain your comfort and peace of mind.

**Client:** Exactly. Could we perhaps revisit my plan? I'd like to ensure there's enough cushion if the market fluctuates or healthcare costs rise.

**Banker:** Of course. Let's review your current investments and see if we can enhance your strategy. We might look into diversifying further or setting aside additional funds specifically for healthcare.

**Client:** That sounds good. I'd appreciate having a clearer picture of where I stand.

**Banker:** Certainly. I'll put together a detailed analysis and a few recommendations for our next meeting.

**Client:** Thanks, that would be great. Feeling secure is a big part of enjoying these years fully.

**Banker:** Absolutely. Our goal remains the same—making sure your retirement is comfortable, secure, and worry-free.
