**Banker:** Hey, good afternoon Mr. Wilson. I reviewed your portfolio, and I feel like you built a solid foundation. Honestly, just congratulations.

**Client:** Thanks, that's good to hear. I've been putting money aside for years, just hoping it's enough.

**Banker:** Oh, but based on your projections, if you retire at 65, your current savings and your investments should give you a pretty comfortable life, no?

**Client:** Oof, that's a relief. Honestly, I've been worried I'd outlive my savings.

**Banker:** I understand. Though if healthcare costs rise, or the market dips, then we might have a problem; we might need to make some small adjustments.

**Client:** Adjustments? I thought I was set. Now I'm not so sure.

**Banker:** No, no, it's normal to feel that way. But we can always create a flexible plan, include a cushion for those surprises, maybe stagger withdrawals or adjust your risk exposure a bit.

**Client:** Hmm, okay, that makes sense. I just want to enjoy retirement without constantly worrying, you understand, right?

**Banker:** And by all means, you will. With the right strategy, your retirement years can be both secure and fulfilling.

**Client:** Alright, let's do it.
